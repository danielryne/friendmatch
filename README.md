# FriendMatch

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically, a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from a user survey (about 10 questions), then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

This application was created using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node, and Express to handle routing.

This app is deployed on my Heroku repo, here: https://thawing-ravine-71362.herokuapp.com/
